## ASIER ZD's GITHUB

I am a software engineer and a Robotics MSc student.
In this account I will be uploading my college practices and personal projects.

> ### Content

Some practices I made during my study of software engineering:
- [**Multilayer-Perceptron-In-C**:](https://github.com/asierzd/Multilayer-Perceptron-In-C) This is my solution to a final practice that consisted in developing a multilayer perceptron from the Programming Fundamentals subject.
- [**Programming-Fundamentals-in-C-Practices:**](https://github.com/asierzd/Programming-Fundamentals-in-C-Practices) Agenda manager programmed in C using linked lists, implemented with arrays, pointers and structs for the Programming Fundamentals subject.
- [**Algorithms-And-Complexity-Practices:**](https://github.com/asierzd/Algorithms-And-Complexity-Practices) Practices from Algorithms and Complexity subject. It contains practices about complexity analysis, sorting algorithms, Divide and conquer, Backtracking/Branch&Bound, Greedy and Dynamic programming algorithmic schemes.

Other practices I made during my study of robotics master:
